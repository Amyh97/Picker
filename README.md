# Amy Hollis Picker Technical task 

## Planned approach

In order to render a project of this smaller size I am going to use Flask in a Python backend. I am then going to take the data from the CSV file provided and put it staright into the project folder. I am going to start by rendering the data to a table that I will put in index.html. 

Once I have the basics of the data rendering I will then move onto finding the average. I will do this by arranging the data to look at all the responses from each hospital and adding the 1s and 0s to an array which I can then add up (using a for loop) and devide by array.length to get the average for what that hospital scored for each question. 

Then when I have the data organised with the means for each hospital I would then look at filtering and adding the drop down options to make it more user friendly.

This is the plan for what I want to do and how I would tackle this problem and then see how far I can get in the time given
